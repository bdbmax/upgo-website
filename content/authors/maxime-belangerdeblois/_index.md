Maxime holds a master's degree in Urban Planning from McGill University and a BA with honours in Political Science and Economics from Université Laval. His educational background reflects a strong interest in sustainable development, political economy, and urban governance, which has shaped his passion for applying data-driven solutions to territorial and environmental issues. During his time as a research assistant with the Urban Politics and Governance Research Group, Maxime primarily focused on analyzing the impact of the short-term rental market on North American cities, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This work deepened his understanding of urban dynamics and sparked an ongoing interest in how data visualization and analysis can be used to address complex urban challenges. Moving forward, Maxime is interested in leveraging data science to develop solutions that can be used for inclusive urban planning, making cities more equitable and sustainable.
